    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Crispy Parmesan Chicken:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut each breast into 3 pieces. Then place between 2 pieces 
            of cling wrap or paper and pound to 1/2 cm / 0.2″ thickness.</li>
        <li>Drizzle chicken with 1/2 tbsp olive oil and spread with your 
            fingers on both sides</li>
        <li>Mix flour, parmesan, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Coat 
            chicken, pressing to adhere, then shaking off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. 
            Then add butter and let it melt.</li>
        <li>Place 3 pieces of chicken in the skillet. Cook 3 – 4 minutes until golden, 
            then turn and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove onto plate, repeat 
            with remaining chicken.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chicken Piccata Sauce:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour out and discard excess fat in skillet, then give it a quick 
            wipe with paper towels (no need to clean thoroughly).</li>
        <li>Still on medium high heat, add wine. Let it simmer rapidly until 
            it reduces by half – around 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add lemon and simmer 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Add cubed butter and swirl pan to make it melt 
            but not go foamy. Sauce should be glossy, translucent and slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir in capers and parsley. Serve chicken with Sauce, sprinkled 
            with extra parsley if desired!</li>
    </ol>
