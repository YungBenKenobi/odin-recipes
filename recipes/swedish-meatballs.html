    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Juicy meatballs smothered in a beautiful creamy gravy, with a hint of spicing 
    that Swedish Meatballs are known for. Made extra soft and extra tasty by soaking 
    fresh bread in grated onion</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Meatballs</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 slices white sandwhich bread<i>, crusts removed, chopped into small cubes</i></li>
        <li>1 onion<i>, small (brown, white or yellow)</i></li>
        <li>300g beef mince</li>
        <li>300g pork mince<i>, or sub with more beef</i></li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg<i>, preferably freshly grated</i></li>
        <li>1/4 tsp All Spice powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gravy</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>40g / 3 tbsp butter<i>, unsalted</i></li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock<i> (salt reduced), or sub with chicken</i></li>
        <li>1/2 cup thickened cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Grate onion using a standard box grater.</li>
        <li>Scrape onion and juices into bowl. Add bread and mix well – onion juice 
        should make bread soggy (if not, add a tiny splash of milk). Set aside to 
        soak for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add remaining Meatball ingredients EXCEPT oil. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Using a tablespoon measure and measure out a heaped tablespoon (or use 
        ice cream scooper which is what I do), dollop on work surface. Repeat with 
        remaining mixture: 25 – 30 meatballs. Then roll into shape.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add half the meatballs 
        and brown all over (but raw inside still) – about 3 minutes. Remove onto plate, 
        then brown the remaining batch.</li>
        <li>If there is lots of oil, pour off excess and discard. 
        Lower heat to medium.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Gravy</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Add butter into skillet and melt. Add flour and stir in. 
        Cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>While mixing, add about 1/4 of the beef broth – it will thicken quickly. 
        Then gradually add remaining beef broth, stirring as you go. Switch to whisk if 
        required to make it lump free.</li>
        <li>When the liquid is simmering, add meatball and juices pooled on plate.</li>
        <li>Turn up heat slightly to keep it at a rapid simmer. Cook for 8 – 10 minutes 
        or until the liquid thickens into a thin gravy, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add cream, simmer for a further 2 minutes then remove from stove.</li>
        <li>Serve over mashed potato (or Cauliflower Mash for low carb). For a truly 
        authentic experience, add a dollop of ligonberry jam on the side!</li>
    </ol>
